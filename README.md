This project is made of Angular and React variants.

## Angular
As my Angular experience is weak, I decided to forgo the full Module system organization and opted
for the newer Angular 15 patterns for a simplified developer experience. I also opted for a folder 
structure that resembles common patterns for React or Vue apps to make the experience simplified as
well.
